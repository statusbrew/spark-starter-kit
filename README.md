Upon arrival, the system assigns a *vacant parking spot* randomly, ensuring quick and easy parking.

### 📍 Guided Navigation
*Textual pop-up* directions guide drivers to their assigned parking spot.

### 🚨 Conflict Management

### 🧠 Future-Ready
Our system is designed with future scalability in mind, with plans to integrate *advanced analytics* for optimal parking management.
